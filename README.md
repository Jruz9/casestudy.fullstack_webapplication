2. open the project from intelj using the pom.xml file
3. run the MainApplication.java class (this should not require any other libraries to download)
4. type in any browser except internet explorer and type [http://localhost:8080/login_form]
5. you will note be able to login in the beginning, click on register and create your account

* **issues**
	* As of this moment only the login is complete and need to implement the classes created for the other part of the application
	* In the moment all the classes needed are completed and the fronend of the applcation for the calorie counter is half completed
	* A completed version of the appicaiton will be ported to another branch since the main branch will be graded.
	* Hope this clarifies some confusion.
